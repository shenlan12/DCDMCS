\defmodule {MathFunction}

This interface should be implemented by classes which represent univariate
mathematical functions. It is used to pass an arbitrary function of one
variable as argument to another function. For example, it is used
in \externalclass{umontreal.iro.lecuyer.util}{RootFinder} to find
 the zeros of a function.
