/**
 * Objects of classes that implement this interface are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">iterators</SPAN> 
 * that permit one to enumerate
 * (or observe) the successive points of a point set and the successive 
 * coordinates of these points.
 * Each {@link PointSetIterator} is associated with a given point set
 * and maintains a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">current point</SPAN> index <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>i</I></SPAN> and a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">current coordinate</SPAN>
 * index <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN>, which are both initialized to zero.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Successive coordinates can be accessed one or many at a time by the methods
 * {@link #nextCoordinate nextCoordinate} and {@link #nextCoordinates nextCoordinates}, respectively.
 * The current coordinate index <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>j</I></SPAN> can be set explicitely by
 * {@link #setCurCoordIndex setCurCoordIndex} and {@link #resetCurCoordIndex resetCurCoordIndex}. 
 * Similar methods are available for resetting and accessing the current point.
 * The method {@link #nextPoint nextPoint} permits one to 
 * enumerate the successive points in natural order. 
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class also implements the {@link RandomStream} interface.
 * This permits one to replace random numbers by the coordinates of
 * (randomized) quasi-Monte Carlo points without changing the code that calls
 * the generators in a simulation program.
 * That is, the same simulation program can be used for both Monte Carlo 
 * and quasi-Monte Carlo simulations.
 * The method {@link #nextDouble nextDouble} does exactly the same as 
 * {@link #nextCoordinate nextCoordinate}, it returns the current coordinate of the 
 * current point and advances the current coordinate by one.  
 * The substreams correspond to the points, so  
 * {@link #resetStartSubstream resetStartSubstream} resets the current point coordinate to zero, 
 * {@link #resetNextSubstream resetNextSubstream} resets the iterator to the next point, and
 * {@link #resetStartStream resetStartStream} resets the iterator to the first point of 
 * the point set.
 * 
 * <P>
 * There can be several iterators over the same point set.
 * These iterators are independent from each other.  
 * Classes that implement this interface must maintain enough information 
 * so that each iterator is unaffected by other iterator's operations.
 * However, the iterator does not need to be independent of the underlying 
 * point set.  If the point set is modified (e.g., randomized), the iterator
 * may continue to work as usual.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Point set iterators are implemented as inner classes because
 * this gives a direct access to the private members (or variables) 
 * of the class.  This is important for efficiency.
 * They are quite similar to the iterators in Java <SPAN  CLASS="textit">collections</SPAN>.
