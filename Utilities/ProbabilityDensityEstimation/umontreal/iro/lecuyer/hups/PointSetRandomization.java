/**
 * This interface is used to randomize a
 * {@link PointSet PointSet}. One can
 * implement method {@link #randomize(PointSet) randomize} in any way. This
 * method must use an internal
 * {@link RandomStream RandomStream}. This
 * stream can be set in the constructor, but the methods
 * {@link #getStream getStream} and {@link #setStream(RandomStream) setStream} must be
 * implemented.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The method {@link #randomize(PointSet) randomize} must be implemented using
 * combinations of the randomization methods from the point set such
 * as
 * {@link PointSet#addRandomShift addRandomShift},
 * {@link DigitalNet#leftMatrixScramble leftMatrixScramble},
 * {@link DigitalNet#stripedMatrixScramble stripedMatrixScramble},
 *  ...
 * 
 * <P>
 * If more than one {@link PointSetRandomization} is applied to the
 * same point set, the randomizations will concatenate if they are of
 * different types, but only the last of each type will remain.
