\title{probdistmulti}{Multivariate Probability Distributions}

%\footnote{\normalsize 
%    Mathieu Bague and Richard Simard
%    have participated in the design and implementation of ProbDistMulti}

This package provides tools to compute densities, mass functions, 
distribution functions 
for various continuous and discrete multivariate probability distributions.
% It also offers facilities for performing and
% reporting different types of univariate goodness-of-fit tests.
