/**
 * This is the base class for all random variate generators over the real line.
 * It specifies the signature of the {@link #nextDouble nextDouble} method, which is
 * normally called to generate a real-valued random variate whose distribution
 * has been previously selected.
 * A random variate generator object can be created simply by invoking the
 * constructor of this class with previously created
 * {@link RandomStream RandomStream} and
 * {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.probdist.Distribution Distribution}
 * objects, or by invoking the constructor of a subclass.
 * By default, all random variates will be generated via
 * inversion by calling the
 * {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.probdist.Distribution#inverseF inverseF}
 * method for the distribution, even though this can be inefficient in some cases.
 * For some of the distributions, there are subclasses with special and
 * more efficient methods to generate the random variates.
 * 
 * <P>
 * For generating many random variates, creating an object and calling
 * the non-static method is more efficient when the generating algorithm
 * involves a significant setup.
 * When no work is done at setup time, the static methods are usually
 * slightly faster.
