/**
 * This class is the multivariate counterpart of
 * {@link RandomVariateGen RandomVariateGen}.
 * It is the base class for general random variate generators over
 * the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>d</I></SPAN>-dimensional real space <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><B>R</B><SUP>d</SUP></SPAN>.
 * It specifies the signature of the {@link #nextPoint nextPoint} method, which is
 * normally called to generate a random vector from a given distribution.
 * Contrary to univariate distributions and generators, here the inversion method
 * is not well defined, so we cannot construct a multivariate generator simply
 * by passing a multivariate distribution and a stream; we must specify a
 * generating method as well.  For this reason, this class is abstract.
 * Generators can be constructed only by invoking the constructor of a subclass.
 * This is an important difference with
 * {@link RandomVariateGen RandomVariateGen}.
