/**
 * This interface defines the basic structures to handle multiple streams
 * of uniform (pseudo)random numbers and convenient
 * tools to move around within and across these streams.
 * The actual random number generators (RNGs) are provided in classes
 * that implement this <TT>RandomStream</TT> interface.
 * Each stream of random numbers is an object of the class that implements
 * this interface, and can be viewed as a virtual random number generator.
 * 
 * <P>
 * For each type of base RNG (i.e., each implementation of the 
 * <TT>RandomStream</TT> interface), the full period of the generator
 * is cut into adjacent <EM>streams</EM> (or segments) of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN>, 
 * and each of these streams is partitioned into <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> <EM>substreams</EM>
 * of length <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I> = <I>VW</I></SPAN>.
 * The values of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>V</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>W</I></SPAN> depend on the specific RNG, but are usually
 * larger than <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>50</SUP></SPAN>.
 * Thus, the distance <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> between the starting points of two successive 
 * streams provided by an RNG usually exceeds <SPAN CLASS="MATH">2<SUP>100</SUP></SPAN>.
 * The initial seed of the RNG is the starting point of the first stream.  
 * It has a default value for each type of RNG,
 * but this initial value can be changed by calling <TT>setPackageSeed</TT> 
 * for the corresponding class.
 * Each time a new <TT>RandomStream</TT> is created, its starting point
 * (initial seed) is computed automatically,
 * <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>Z</I></SPAN> steps ahead of the starting point of the previously created stream
 * of the same type, and its current state is set equal to this starting point.
 * 
 * <P>
 * For each stream, one can advance by one step and generate one value,
 * or go ahead to the beginning of the next substream within this stream, 
 * or go back to the beginning of the current substream, or to the beginning
 * of the stream, or jump ahead or back by an arbitrary number of steps.
 * Denote by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>C</I><SUB>g</SUB></SPAN> the current state of a stream <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>g</I></SPAN>,
 * <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>I</I><SUB>g</SUB></SPAN> its initial state, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>B</I><SUB>g</SUB></SPAN> the state at the beginning of the
 * current substream, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I><SUB>g</SUB></SPAN> the state at the beginning of the next substream.
 * 
 * The form of the state of a stream depends on its type.
 * For example, the state of a stream of class {@link MRG32k3a} is a vector
 * of six 32-bit integers represented internally as floating-point numbers
 * (in <TT>double</TT>).
 * 
 * <P>
 * The methods for manipulating the streams and generating random
 * numbers are implemented differently for each type of RNG.
 * The methods whose formal parameter types do not depend
 * on the RNG type are specified in the interface <TT>RandomStream</TT>.
 * The others (e.g., for setting the seeds) are given only in the
 * classes that implement the specific RNG types.
 * 
 * <P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Methods for generating random variates from non-uniform distributions
 * are provided in the {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.randvar randvar} package.
