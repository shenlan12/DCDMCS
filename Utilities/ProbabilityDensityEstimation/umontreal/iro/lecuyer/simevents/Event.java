/**
 * This abstract class provides event scheduling tools.
 * Each type of event should be defined as a subclass of the
 * class <TT>Event</TT>, and should provide an implementation of the method
 * {@link #actions actions} which is executed when an event of this type occurs.
 * The instances of these subclasses are the actual events.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Each event is linked to a simulator represented by an instance of
 * {@link Simulator} before it can be scheduled and processed.
 * A default simulator, given by <TT>Simulator.getDefaultSimulator</TT>,
 * is used if no simulator is linked explicitly with an event.
 * When an event is constructed, it is not scheduled. It must be scheduled
 * separately by calling one of the scheduling methods {@link #schedule schedule},
 * {@link #scheduleNext scheduleNext}, {@link #scheduleBefore scheduleBefore}, etc.
 * An event can also be cancelled before it occurs.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A scheduled event has an associated time at which it will happen and a priority,
 * which can be queried using the methods {@link #time time} and {@link #priority priority}, respectively.
 * By default, events occur in ascending order of time, and have priority 1.
 * Events with the same time occur in ascending order of priority.
 * For example, if events <TT>e1</TT> and <TT>e2</TT> occur at the same time
 * with priority 2 and 1 respectively, then <TT>e2</TT> will occur before <TT>e1</TT>.
 * Events with the same time and priority occur in the order they were scheduled.
 *
