/**
 * An interface for implementations of event lists.
 * Different implementations are provided in SSJ:
 * doubly-linked list, splay tree, Henricksen's method, etc.
 * The <EM>events</EM> in the event list are objects of the class
 * {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.simevents.Event Event}.
 * The method {@link umontreal.iro.lecuyer.simevents.Sim#init(EventList) Sim.init}
 * permits one to select
 * the actual implementation used in a simulation.
 * 
 * <P>
 * To allow the user to print the event list, the 
 * {@link Object#toString toString} method
 * from the {@link Object} class should be reimplemented in all <TT>EventList</TT>
 * implementations.  It will return a string in the following format:
 * ``<TT>Contents of the event list </TT><SPAN  CLASS="textit">event list class</SPAN><TT>:</TT>'' for the first line and
 * each subsequent line has format 
 * ``<SPAN  CLASS="textit">scheduled event time</SPAN><TT>, </TT><SPAN  CLASS="textit">event priority</SPAN>&nbsp;<TT>:</TT>&nbsp;<SPAN  CLASS="textit">event string</SPAN>''.
 * The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">event string</SPAN> is obtained by calling the
 * <TT>toString</TT> method of the event objects.
 * The string should not end with the end-of-line character.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The following example is the event list of the bank example,
 * printed at 10h30.  See <TT>examples.pdf</TT> for more information.
 * 
 * <P>
 * <PRE>
 * Contents of the event list SplayTree:
 *    10.51,        1 : BankEv$Arrival@cfb549
 *    10.54,        1 : BankEv$Departure@8a7efd
 *       11,        1 : BankEv$3@86d4c1
