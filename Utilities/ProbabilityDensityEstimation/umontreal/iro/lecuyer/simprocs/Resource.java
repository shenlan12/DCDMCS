/**
 * Objects of this class are resources having limited capacity,
 * and which can be requested and released by {@link Process} objects.
 * These resources act indirectly as synchonization devices for
 * processes.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A resource is created with a finite capacity, specified when 
 * invoking the {@link #Resource(int) Resource} constructor, and can be changed
 * later on.  A resource also has an infinite-capacity queue
 * (waiting line) and a service policy that defaults to FIFO and
 * can be changed later on.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A process must ask for a certain number of units of the resource
 * ({@link #request request}), and obtain it before using it.
 * When it is done with the resource, the process must release 
 * it so that others can use it ({@link #release release}).
 * A process does not have to request [release] all the resource
 * units that it needs by a single call to the {@link #request request}
 * [{@link #release release}] method.  It can make several successive requests
 * or releases, and can also hold different resources simultaneously.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Each resource maintains two lists: one contains the processes 
 * waiting for the resource (the waiting queue) and the other contains
 * the processes currently holding units of this resource.
 * The methods {@link #waitList waitList} and {@link #servList servList} permit one to
 * access these two lists.
 * These lists actually contain objects of the class {@link UserRecord}
 * instead of {@link SimProcess} objects.
