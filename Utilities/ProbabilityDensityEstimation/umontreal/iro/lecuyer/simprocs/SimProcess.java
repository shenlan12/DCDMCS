/**
 * This abstract class provides process scheduling tools.
 * Each type of process should be defined as a subclass of the
 * class <TT>SimProcess</TT>, and must provide an implementation of the method
 * {@link #actions actions} which describes the life of a process of this class.
 * Whenever a process instance starts, its {@link #actions actions} method
 * begins executing.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Just like an event, a process must first be constructed, then scheduled.
 * Scheduling a process is equivalent to placing an event in the event list
 * that will start this process when
 * the simulation clock reaches the specified time.
 * The {@link #toString toString} method can be overridden to return
 * information about the process.  This information will
 * be returned when formating the event list as a string, if the
 * process is delayed.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A process can be in one of the following states: <TT>INITIAL</TT>,
 * <TT>EXECUTING</TT>, <TT>DELAYED</TT>, <TT>SUSPENDED</TT>, and <TT>DEAD</TT>
 * .
 * At most <EM>one</EM> process can be in the <TT>EXECUTING</TT> state at
 * any given time, and when there is one, this executing process
 * (called the <EM>current process</EM>) is said to <EM>have control</EM>
 * and is executing one of the instructions of its {@link #actions actions} method.
 * A process that has been constructed but not yet scheduled is in
 * the <TT>INITIAL</TT> state.
 * A process is in the <TT>DELAYED</TT> state if there is a planned event
 * in the event list to activate it (give it control).
 * When a process is scheduled, it is placed in the <TT>DELAYED</TT> state.
 * It is in the <TT>SUSPENDED</TT> state if it is waiting to be reactivated
 * (i.e., obtain control) without having an event to do so in the event list.
 * A process can suspends itself by calling {@link #suspend suspend} directly or
 * indirectly (e.g., by requesting a busy {@link Resource}).
 * Usually, a <TT>SUSPENDED</TT> process must be reactivated by another process
 * or event via the {@link #resume resume} method.
 * A process in the <TT>DEAD</TT> state no longer exists.
 * 
 * <P>
 * To construct new processes, the user needs to extend {@link SimProcess}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Note: the user needs to ensure that the <TT>actions</TT>
 * method of any process can be terminated, i.e., no infinite loops.
 * For example, using threads process-oriented simulator,
 * if such a method never terminates, threads will not be recycled,
 * causing memory problems.
