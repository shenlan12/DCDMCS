\defmodule {VarianceGammaProcessDiffPCASymmetricalBridge}

Same as \class{VarianceGammaProcessDiff}, but the two
inner \class{GammaProcess}'es are of the PCASymmetricalBridge type.
Also, \texttt{generatePath(double[] uniform01)} distributes the
lowest coordinates uniforms to the inner
GammaProcessPCA according to their eigenvalues.

\begin{tabb}Constructs a new
\class{VarianceGammaProcessDiffPCASymmetricalBridge} with
parameters  $\theta = \texttt{theta}$, $\sigma = \texttt{sigma}$, $\nu = \texttt{nu}$
and initial value $S(t_{0}) = \texttt{s0}$.  There is only
one \externalclass{umontreal.iro.lecuyer.rng}{RandomStream} here which is
used for the two inner \class{GammaProcessPCASymmetricalBridge}'s.  The other
parameters are set as in \class{VarianceGammaProcessDiff}.
