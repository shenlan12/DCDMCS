This package provides classes to define stochastic processes 
$\{X(t),\, t\ge 0\}$, and to simulate their sample paths at a finite 
number of (discrete) observation times $t_0 \le t_1 \le \cdots \le t_d$.
The observation of the generated path is thus the vector
$(X(t_0),X(t_1),\dots,X(t_d))$.

The observation times $t_0, \dots, t_d$ can be specified (or changed) 
after defining the process, with the method \texttt{setObservationTimes}.
The random stream used to generate the sample path can also be changed,
using \texttt{setStream}.
