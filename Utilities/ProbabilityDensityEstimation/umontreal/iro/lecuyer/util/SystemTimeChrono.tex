\defmodule{SystemTimeChrono}

Extends the \class{AbstractChrono} class to compute
the total system time using Java's builtin \texttt{System.nanoTime}.
The system can be used as a rough approximation of the CPU time taken
by a program if no
other tasks are executed on the host while the program is running.
