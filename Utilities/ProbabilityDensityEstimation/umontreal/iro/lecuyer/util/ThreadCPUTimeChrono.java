/**
 * Extends the {@link AbstractChrono} 
 * class to compute the CPU time for a single thread. It is available
 * only under Java 1.5 which provides platform-independent 
 * facilities to get the CPU time for a single thread through management API.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Note that this chrono might not work properly on some systems running Linux because
 * of a bug in Sun's implementation or Linux kernel.
 * For instance, this class unexpectedly computes the global CPU time
 * under Fedora 
 * Core&nbsp;4, kernel 2.6.17 and JRE version 1.5.0-09.
 * With Fedora Core&nbsp;6, kernel 2.6.20, the function is working properly.
 * As a result, one should not rely on this bug to get the global CPU time.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Note that the above bug does not prevent one from using this chrono to
 * compute the CPU time for a single-threaded application.  In that case,
 * the global CPU time corresponds to the CPU time of the current thread.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Running timer fonctions when the associated thread is dead will return 0.
