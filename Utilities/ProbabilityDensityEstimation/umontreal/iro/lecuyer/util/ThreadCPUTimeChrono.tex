\defmodule{ThreadCPUTimeChrono}

Extends the \class{AbstractChrono} 
class to compute the CPU time for a single thread. It is available
only under Java 1.5 which provides platform-independent 
facilities to get the CPU time for a single thread through management API.

Note that this chrono might not work properly on some systems running Linux because
of a bug in Sun's implementation or Linux kernel.
For instance, this class unexpectedly computes the global CPU time
under Fedora 
Core~4, kernel 2.6.17 and JRE version 1.5.0-09.
With Fedora Core~6, kernel 2.6.20, the function is working properly.
As a result, one should not rely on this bug to get the global CPU time.

Note that the above bug does not prevent one from using this chrono to
compute the CPU time for a single-threaded application.  In that case,
the global CPU time corresponds to the CPU time of the current thread.

Running timer fonctions when the associated thread is dead will return 0.
