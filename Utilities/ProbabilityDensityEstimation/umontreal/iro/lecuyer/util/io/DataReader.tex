\end{tabb}
\begin{code}

   public int readInt (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}
\begin{tabb}

\end{tabb}
\begin{code}

   public double readDouble (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}
\begin{tabb}
Reads the first field labeled as \texttt{label} and returns its \texttt{double} value.
\end{tabb}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Reading one-dimensional arrays}
\begin{code}

   public String[] readStringArray (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}
\begin{tabb}

\end{tabb}
\begin{code}

   public int[] readIntArray (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}
\begin{tabb}
Reads the first field labeled as \texttt{label} and returns its value as a one-dimensional array of \texttt{int}'s.
\end{tabb}
\begin{code}

   public float[] readFloatArray (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}

\end{tabb}
\begin{code}

   public double[] readDoubleArray (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}
\begin{tabb}
Reads the first field labeled as \texttt{label} and returns its value as a one-dimensional array of \texttt{double}'s.
\end{tabb}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Reading two-dimensional arrays}
\begin{code}

   public String[][] readStringArray2D (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}

\end{tabb}
\begin{code}

   public float[][] readFloatArray2D (String label) throws IOException;
\end{code}
\begin{tabb}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection*{Reading fields of unknown type}
\begin{code}

   public Map<String, DataField> readAllNextFields() throws IOException;
\end{code}
\begin{tabb}
