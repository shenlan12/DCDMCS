Algorithm:
1. algorithm design pattern
    * it takes strategic design pattern to includes:
        1) initialization
        2) clustering
        3) modeling
        4) stopping criteria
2. for each parts in algorithm
    * it takes singleton and factory design pattern to instantiate instances:
        1) singleton design pattern to create unique instance for each part
        2) each unique instance takes corresponding type of instance according to configuration in config file.

Data Access Operator:
1. dao designs and implements the function of loading data into system

Starter:
1. starter works as the main function
2. instances starts with index 1
3. cluster labe starts with index 0
4. state number starts with index 0
